### Marketing plan

2. Leveraging Existing Social Media Following:
* Utilize the existing following on Mr. Kris's social media accounts dedicated to his tattoo artistry to promote the e-commerce application and the homepage. Post regular updates, stories, and announcements on these accounts, highlighting the availability of printed artworks for purchase and providing a link to the homepage.

3. Email Campaigns:

Adjust marketing strategies based on insights gained from these analytics, optimizing efforts to maximize results and return on investment (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Heatmap tools like Hotjar or Crazy Egg).

Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of each marketing channel and adapt the plan accordingly to ensure continued success in promoting the homepage and increasing sales of Mr. Kris's artworks.

### Planning

A significant amount of effort went into the planning phase to determine the layout and structure of the agile board. Following a solo meeting where I switched between the roles of product owner, user, and developer, it was decided that Github projects would serve as the ideal agile tool for the Me. Kris Tattoo Shop PP5 project. With only limited time remaining until the project deadline, it was decided to break the development process into four iterations, each lasting one week.

Once the project's scope was clearly defined, I proceeded to create milestones and epics to help organize the development process. User stories and tasks were added to the backlog and prioritized using the M.o.S.C.o.W prioritization technique. Afterwards, each task was assigned to the appropriate milestone and iteration.
